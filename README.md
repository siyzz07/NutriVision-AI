Food Image Nutrition Analyzer is a web-based application that enables users to upload food images and receive instant nutritional analysis. The system leverages AI-powered image recognition to identify the food item and extract detailed nutritional information, including calories, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, ingredients, and other key nutrients. Along with the nutritional breakdown, the application provides a concise description of the food to help users understand its dietary value and health impact. The goal of this project is to make nutrition information easily accessible and intuitive, supporting healthier food choices through a simple and user-friendly experience.
